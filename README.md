# Yolo-UWP
An YoloV2Tiny ONNX Model runs in UWP

Model can be downloaded from https://github.com/onnx/models/tree/master/vision/object_detection_segmentation/tiny-yolov2

This is the only yolo model I find compativle with UWP WinML

Put the onnx model under Folder 'Assets' and open the solution with Visual Studio
